|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Random Sampling           | Each data point has an equal probability of being selected.                                       |
| Systematic Sampling              | Data points are selected at regular intervals.                                                   |
| Stratified Sampling              | Data is split into strata and sampled proportionally from each group.                            |
| Cluster Sampling                 | Random clusters of data points are chosen, and all members of selected clusters are included.    |
| Cross-Validation                 | A statistical method for evaluating models by splitting the dataset into training and testing.    |
